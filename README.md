# GreenStitch Backend Assessment

My task was to create a backend for a login and signup REST API with security features and web tokens for authentication. Using the H2 database, and the project should be built on the Spring Boot framework.

## About the project
User is able to sign-up(create new account) or login using existing credentials. User is able to communicate through REST Api calls. If user is not authorized then access is denied to user. For authorization we have used jwt, When user logs in successfully then a token is generated and It is authenticated before anyone is trying to access the data from database.


## Technology
* Java 17+
